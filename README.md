## Algorithms & Computing Introduction


<div align="justified">  
Content:
Basic concepts about algorithms and methods for their construction. Types of data and variables. Fundamental structures of programs: sequential, conditional and with repetition. Functions. Homogeneous composite variables: vectors and matrices. Language-ready package libraries for Data Science algorithms, starting with data visualization algorithms. Discussions about the past (structured data), present (Big Data and Data Science, texts) and future of computing (intensive use of artificial intelligence and machine learning).

Projects: 1, 2 & 3
